                            <i className="privacy-italic-header">Device/Usage Information</i>
                            <p>We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze:</p>
                            <ul className="privacy-links">

                            <p>We also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs and online tracking technologies, like cookies and/or tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to:</p>
                            <ul className="privacy-links">
                                <li>recognize your computer;</li>
                                <li>store your preferences and settings;</li>
                                <li>understand the web pages of the Services you have visited and the referral sites that have led you to our Services;</li>
                                <li>perform searches and analytics; and</li>

                            <p>Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. If you receive email from us (such as updates from the Wick Editor forum), we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on any links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.  As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>
                            <p>Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.

You may have the right to object to our handling of your information, restrict our processing of your information, and to withdraw any consent you have provided. To exercise these rights, please email us at <a href="@mailto:contact@wickeditor.com">contact@wickeditor.com</a> with the nature of your request. You also have the right to go directly to the relevant supervisory or legal authority, but we encourage you to contact us so that we may resolve your concerns directly as best and as promptly as we can.</li>

                        <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States and the majority of our contractors are based in the United States. As described above in the “When We Disclose Your Information” section, we may share your information with trusted service providers or business partners in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, in accordance with applicable law. This means that some of your information may be processed in the United States, which may not offer the same level of protection as the privacy laws of your jurisdiction. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.</p>
                        <p>If we provide any information about you to any third parties information processors located outside of the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy and other data protection laws to govern the transfers of such data.</p>
                    <h2 id="security-measures">Security Measures</h2>
                        <p>We have implemented technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.</p>
                    <h2 id="Children">Children</h2>
                        <p>All Services provided by Wicklets where users are asked to provide personal information, such as the Wick Editor forum, are intended for users over the age of 13. In all other Services, we do our best to ensure that no personal data is collected, and only anonymized usage statistics are recorded. If we become aware that we have collected personal information (as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, or personal data (as defined by the EU GDPR) from children under the age of 16, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as practicable. If you believe that your child falls into one of these categories and has submitted personal information to us, please send an email to <a href="@mailto:contact@wickeditor.com">contact@wickeditor.com</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h2>
                        <p>We retain the information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy or as long as we are legally required or permitted to do so. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.</p>
                    <h2 id="third-party-links-and-services">Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
                        <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., social media sites like Facebook and Twitter), third-party plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “like” button and Twitter “follow” button), and other services. If you choose to use these sites or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Wicklets is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third party websites or services. The collection, use and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every site you visit.</p>
                    <h2 id="Changes to this Privacy Policy">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy as we update and expand our Services, and we may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. We will post any changes here and revise the date last updated above. We encourage you to check this page periodically for updates to stay informed on how we collect, use and share your information. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice as required by law.</p>
